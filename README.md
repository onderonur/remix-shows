## ‚å®Ô∏è Development

To start development, we should get our API key from [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) first.  
After that, we create a `.env` file and set our environment variables:

```
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Install our packages:

```
npm install
```

And when the installation is completed, we can run the app by:

```
npm run dev
```

and it will start at `http://localhost:3000`.
